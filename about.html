			<h2>An-Nahj Islamic Institute</h2>
			<p>
				Founded in early 2025, An-Nahj Islamic Institute was established with a clear
				mission: to spread beneficial knowledge until it reaches everyone, by
				the permission of Allah. The institute provides a structured, reliable,
				and accessible platform where Muslims can learn Qur’an, Arabic, Hadith,
				and basic Islamic jurisprudence from anywhere.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>What Makes An-Nahj Different</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Accessible and affordable system with a small, affordable monthly commitment fee. This ensures that anyone can enroll irrespective of their financial abilities.
				</li>
				<li>Structured yet flexible for university students and workers.</li>
				<li>
					Manhaj-based curriculum upon the Qur’an and Sunnah according to the
					Salaf. This is necessary because knowledge is religion and must be taken from people whose aqeedah and Manhaj are trustworthy, bi idhniLlāhi.
				</li>
				<li>Fully online-based learning to give room for everyone to learn from the comfort of their homes.</li>
				<li>Discipline, sincerity, taqwah, and proper Islamic etiquettes are what our institute is based upon.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h2>Values, Conduct and Discipline</h2>
			<p>
				Students are required to maintain seriousness, avoid unnecessary mixing,
				respect instructors, and uphold Islamic etiquettes in the online space just as they maintain them physically.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Vision and Future Plans</h2>
			<p>
				The long-term goal is to expand into physical centers across Nigeria and
				make authentic knowledge accessible to every Muslim, bi idhniLlāhi.
