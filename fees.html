			<h2>Fees and Enrollment</h2>
			<p>Classes are free. Students only pay a ₦3000 monthly commitment fee. This is one of the ways we ensure that anyone can join our institute. Though classes are free, we believe that this commitment fee is going to make each student and the instructors feel "committed" to the program.</p>

			<h2>Eligibility</h2>
			<p>
				Our classes are open to all age class, academic level, etc. Students are to choose a suitable class and a screening test might be done to verify the preliminary knowledge of the student.
