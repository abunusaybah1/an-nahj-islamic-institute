			<h2>Our Instructor</h2>
			<p>
				All classes are currently taught by Abu Nusaybah An-Nahjiy (may Allah continue to guide and preserve him upon islam and sunnah). He has years of experience teaching Qur’an, tajweed, Arabic, hadith, and fiqh, both
				online and physically. By the permission of Allah, he is known for simplifying complex concepts and helping beginners grow steadily. Allahumma Baarik!
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>Bi idhniLlāhi, we are working towards employing as much new instructors as possible. May Allah ease it.</p>
